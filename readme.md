#database

we're hosting on the cloud using Mongo ATLAS, 
initial challenges were establishing a connection and being able store information.



#listing

listing works, but can only add images via link to that image,
we wanted to upload image from your machine, and store the path to the image in our database
but unfortunatley we could crack that.

the property owner can then list their propety, giving the price field, a description which will conatain the address, and 
a link to an image.

#booking

once a listing has been created a user can then log in view all available listing, click on a particualr listing
an book it, this will then remove the listing form the list of available listings.

#filter

filtering is very basic, the user can only filter by clicking on a particular they wish to book accommodation e.g 15/06/2019
the all available listings for that date will shown.
